# Bomb-Squad
You are an explosive specialist secret agent on the Bomb Squad tasked with stopping The Bomb King’s evil empire by defeating enemies, ‘known as Crazies’, and completing challenging puzzles.

Design documentation on this project can be found in the PDF located in the master branch. The Bomb Squad project was the third assignment designed for a first year 'Introduction to Computer Game Design' course at Carleton University. Based off a previous theoretical concept, the game was implemented shortly after.
